**The Blind Side**

Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron), a homeless African American teenager, 
has experienced instability in the education system for an extended period. However, his life takes a significant turn 
when Leigh Anne Tuohy (portrayed by Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean (played by 
Tim McGraw) decide to bring him into their home. Over time, the Tuohys become Michael's legal 
guardians, leading to transformative changes in both his life and theirs. Michael, with his 
remarkable size and protective instincts, emerges as a formidable presence on the football field. 
Supported by his newfound family and a dedicated tutor, he discovers and fulfills his potential 
both academically and athletically. This is my one of my favourite because it is a real story and it inspires me.
